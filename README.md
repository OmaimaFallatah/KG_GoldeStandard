# GoldenStandard
The process of creating and evaluating the mappings and annotation task. This GS is for evaluating matchers on matching the classes of large and domain-independent KGs such as DBpedia, NELL and YAGO. We provide two dataset: the samll test case only include a small number of instances for each class, while the origninal dataset includes the full A-Box for all the classes.
